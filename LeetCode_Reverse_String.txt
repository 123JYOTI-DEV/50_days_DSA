
//Question

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Follow up: Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length-1;
        while(left<right)
        {
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left]=s[right];
            s[right]=temp;
            left+=1;
            right-=1;
            
        
        }
        
    }
}
